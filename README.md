## **Wait, What’s Njinx?** 🤔

Good question! **Njinx** is a **lightweight** but **powerful** Java library designed to make managing your Nginx web server a breeze. It's got all the tools you need to **parse**, **modify**, and **command** your `nginx.conf`, all in Java. And yes, the "J" in **Njinx** is because Java deserves to be part of the fun! 😎

## **Why Should You Care?** 🎉

Because Nginx management doesn’t have to be a pain! With Njinx, you can:
- **Parse and edit** your `nginx.conf` file like a pro (with Java objects!).
- Easily **start**, **stop**, and **restart** Nginx right from your Java app (because why open a terminal?).
- Validate your configuration before launching, so no more config errors when you’re deploying under pressure. 😬

### **Best Part?** It’s small but **mighty**—a true **lightweight Nginx manager** for Java! 🚀

## **How to Get Njinx** 🛠️

Adding Njinx to your project is as simple as copy-pasting the following into your Maven `pom.xml`:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.github.dumijdev</groupId>
    <artifactId>njinx</artifactId>
    <version>0.1.0</version>
</dependency>
```

Now, buckle up! Let’s take Njinx for a spin! 🎢

## **Let’s Talk Features!** 💡

### **1. Parsing Your `nginx.conf`** 📜

Reading your Nginx config in Java? No sweat. Njinx lets you transform your `nginx.conf` into a **friendly, easy-to-use** Java object.

```java
// Step 1: Create the Njinx parser
NjinxConfigParser parser = new NjinxConfigParser();

// Step 2: Load your config from a string or file
NginxConfig config = parser.read(nginxConf);

// Step 3: Admire how neat it looks as a Java object
System.out.println(config);
```

Now you can **tinker**, **modify**, and **explore** your Nginx config with Java code! 💻

### **2. Writing Nginx Config Files** ✍️

Manually editing `nginx.conf`? Ain’t nobody got time for that! Njinx lets you build your Nginx config from scratch, like you're playing with **Lego blocks**.

```java
// Step 1: Create the NginxConfig object
NginxConfig config = new NginxConfig();

// Step 2: Add some basic parameters (like a boss)
config.add(new SimpleParam("user", "nobody")); 
config.add(new SimpleParam("worker_processes", "1"));

// Step 3: Add some HTTP magic
Http http = new Http();
http.add(new Server()
            .add(new SimpleParam("listen", "8080"))
            .add(new Location("/")
                .add(new SimpleParam("root", "html"))));
config.add(http);

// Step 4: Save it to a file (because you're awesome)
parser.write(config, new File("/path/to/nginx.conf"));
```

With just a few lines of Java, your Nginx config is ready to go! ⚙️

### **3. Managing Nginx from Java** 🎛️

Tired of jumping between your app and the terminal? With Njinx, you can control Nginx directly from your Java app:

```java
// Step 1: Create an Nginx manager and point it to your Nginx executable
NginxManager manager = new NginxManager("/path/to/nginx");

// Step 2: Start Nginx asynchronously (so you can multitask)
manager.startAsync();

// Step 3: Stop it when you’re done (because you’re the boss)
manager.stop();
```

No more juggling between command lines and your Java code! 🎯
